The sound dogs make



Build a round robin team building application that takes in two CSV files:
  Attendance File: Everyone at the current meeting
  Score File: Contains a list of scoring metrics organized by name
  
The round robin application should build the most balanced teams possible with an algorithm chosen by the given team.
